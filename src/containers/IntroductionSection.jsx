Couldnâ€™t have asked for a better life partner than Pragya. Both of us being from completely different fields will make life even more exciting. In such a short span, she has shown that she is so caring and adjusting which is mesmerising. Looking forward to a better phase of life.</p></div>`;

<p>Chaitanya, from the very first moment we met, I hoped it would be you, I've carried around the image of you in my heart my whole life. From this day onwards, you shall not walk alone. As I have given you my hand to hold, I give you my life to keep. I can't wait to celebrate our wedding day with you.
